# slideshowstopper
Simple, fast slideshow software for churches and shows, that you can easily edit and add to with some web know-how!

WARNING: WIP, NOT READY FOR FIELD WORK! (but feel free to mess around with it and let me know if you want to contribute)

## Where it works

Any Windows machine starting from Windows XP SP3. It takes very little power to boot up and run.

You may use it anywhere you want; you don't have to pay for this software.

## How it works

It uses php-desktop (another great project), cut down to the essentials for Slideshowstopper.

## Current Features

* Not much, but it's pretty fast. (Hey, as I said it's a WIP!)

## Planned Features

* Animated text
* Customizable fonts

## I want cool video and photo backgrounds! But I don't have any.
